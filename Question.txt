ICT0544 ‚Äì INTRO. TO PROGRAMMING
ASSIGNMENT 2 (32 marks)

QUESTION:

A course registration system is offering several courses under the Arts and Sciences categories.  A student is allowed to choose and register a number of courses (max is six) and the system will count the number of courses in each category.  

Write a C program to check for a valid matric number that contains six digits. Display appropriate message if the matric number is invalid. 

The system will display all courses with their codes as follows:   

	A ‚Äì Accounting		B ‚Äì Business 		C ‚Äì Computing	
	E ‚Äì Engineering		M ‚Äì Medicine		P ‚Äì Pharmacy

Then, request a user to enter the number of courses and the codes of selected courses.  If a user enters the wrong code, the program will display a warning message ‚ÄúInvalid Code!‚Äù. The program will count and display the number of courses registered under the Art and Science categories. (Note:  All courses are under Science category except for Accounting and Business)

The program should:
1.	print list of courses,
2.	get the number of courses taken, and
3.	get the codes, to count the number of courses under each category, and to display the number of registered Art and Science courses for that student.
The system also calculates total credit hours for the courses registered (credit hour for Art subject is four and Science subject is five).
A student may decide to reset or submit the registration data (number of courses and course codes).

REMINDER:

This is an individual assignment. No team work is assessed this time. No discussion is allowed and do not copy/plagiarize your friend‚Äôs work. Cheating is easy, getting caught is easier. If I find two similar codes, both parties will be penalized.

To be truly successful, you must begin with being truthful to yourself. Honesty is success.
